Prerequisite for Learning DevOps

(Tools to Install Before You Continue)

Before you start learning DevOps concepts, pipelines, and cloud tools, there are a few basic tools you must have on your system. These tools will help you practice commands, understand how servers work, and follow along with real DevOps tasks.

At this stage, we are only installing essential tools. Advanced tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, or Jenkins will come later when they are truly needed.
