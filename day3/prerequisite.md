# Prerequisite for Learning DevOps

(Tools to Install Before You Continue)

Before you start learning DevOps concepts, pipelines, and cloud tools, there are a few basic tools you must have on your system. These tools will help you practice commands, understand how servers work, and follow along with real DevOps tasks.

At this stage, we are only installing essential tools. Advanced tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, or Jenkins will come later when they are truly needed.

A Computer (Basic Requirement)

To learn DevOps properly, you need a laptop or desktop computer. DevOps involves working with servers, commands, files, and configurations — a mobile phone will not work.

**Minimum recommendation:**
* At least 4GB RAM (8GB is better)
* Windows, macOS, or Linux
* Stable internet connection

DevOps is hands-on. You must be able to install software and run commands.
